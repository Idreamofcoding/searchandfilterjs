# searchandfilterjs
a search and filter for a custom website with custom data using vanilla js. I spent sooo much time trying to figure out how to do this. Googling search bars js did not help me but after months i finally figured out how to make this happen. Thank God! Progress..
Update: This is not my own code (javascript) I found the code from a tutorial "Product Filter and Search Using Javascript" on codingartistweb
